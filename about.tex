I study the application of mathematics to control design, specifically nonlinear control design.
My work focusses on applying exterior differential systems, an esoteric theory of partial differential equations and differential geometry, to feedback linearization problems.
It is best to show this by way of example
Consider the differential equation model of system with two states \((x(t), y(t))\in\mathbb{R}\) given by
\[
\begin{aligned}
  \dot{x}(t) &= y(t)^3 + (y(t) + 1) u(t),\\
  \dot{y}(t) &= -x(t)^2 - x(t) u(t)
\end{aligned}
\]
and say we could control a real number \(u(t)\in\mathbb{R}\) at any moment of time \(t \in \mathbb{R}.\)
This is a problem that appears in designing robotic control systems.
Does there exist an input \(u(t)\) that drives the states \(x(t)\) and \(y(t)\) to \(0\)?
To answer this question, let us initially ask a different question.
Can we find a change of coordinates \(\Phi: (x,y,u) \mapsto (w,z,v)\) so that the dynamics appear as,
\[
\begin{aligned}
  \dot{w}(t) &= z(t),\\
  \dot{z}(t) &= v(t).
\end{aligned}
\]
From linear system theory (an undergraduate engineering topic), we know that we can drive \(w(t)\) and \(z(t)\) to \(0\) by choosing
\[
  v(t) = k_1 w(t) + k_2 z(t),\quad k_1, k_2 > 0.
\]
Then, using the fact that \(u(t)\) can be written in terms of \(v(t),\) we can design a controller that drives \(x\) and \(y\) as well.
How do we find that change of coordinates \(\Phi\) and to what extent of the state space is this choice valid even if it were to exist?
Using the tools of exterior differential calculus or a little ingenuity (this example is simple), it is easy to produce the change of coordinates
\[
\begin{aligned}
  \Phi(x,y,u) &=
    \left(
      \frac{1}{2}x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(y+1)^2 - \frac{1}{2},
      x y^3 - (y + 1) x^2,
      \alpha(x,y) + \beta(x,y) u
    \right),\\
  \alpha(x,y) &= 
    y^6
    - 3 x^3 y^2
    + x^2
    - 2 (y + 1) x y^3,\\
  \beta(x,y) &=
    y^3 (y + 1)
    - 3 x^2 y^2
    + x^3
    - 2 (y + 1)^2 x.
\end{aligned}
\]
In these coordinates --- of course assuming the coordinate transformation is valid, which it is only on a small set containing the origin \((x,y) = 0\) --- the differential equation model looks like a linear system.
In fact, it is a double integrator (\(1/s^2\)) so control design is rendered trivial as described earlier by our choice for \(v(t)\).

The question of how to find such a coordinate change was resolved in the early 80s and 90s by a number of control theorists and their development.
These include Hermann, Gardner, Shadwick, Hunt and Su.
Hermann, Hunt and Su applied the modern differential geometric tools to determine when such a coordinate change exists.
Gardner and Shadwick used the exterior differential calculus to make the job of finding this transformation as easy as possible.

What if you only wanted \emph{part} of the system to be controlled?
For example, suppose you wanted your robot to observe a constraint --- such as following a path --- but you were otherwise indifferent about the behaviour of this system?
Transverse feedback linearization was initially explored by Banaszuk and Hauser in the 90s to tackle this issue in part and fully developed by Nielsen and Maggiore in the the early 2010s.
Unfortunately, the procedure they developed didn't take advantage of the symmetries found in the problem that allow one to construct the solution as Gardner and Shadwick had.
My work filled this gap by also leveraging the tools of exterior differential calculus thereby providing a procedure a control designer can use to find the transformation.

Overall, I want to use math to solve interesting and hard problems in engineering.
I am interested in applying interesting and otherwise esoteric techniques in mathematics to abstract and foundationally rethink how we go about engineering and understanding systems.
