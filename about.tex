Rollen S. D'Souza is currently a PhD Candidate in Electrical \& Computer Engineering specializing in the theory of nonlinear control design at the \href{https://uwaterloo.ca/}{University of Waterloo} in Waterloo, Ontario, Canada.
He is supervised by \href{https://ece.uwaterloo.ca/~cnielsen/}{Prof. Chris Nielsen}.

What exactly does he research?

Currently Rollen investigates an application of \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_ideal}{exterior differential systems} to solving \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feedback_linearization}{feedback equivalence problems}.
These are problems that appear in designing nonlinear control laws for nonlinear systems such as those that model the physical (Newtonian) dynamics of a robotic arm.
