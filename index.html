  Rollen S. D'Souza holds a PhD and BSE from the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/">University of Waterloo</a>.
  He is interested in geometry and its applications to engineering problems, especially in robotics.
  Nowadays, he is a Member of Technical Staff at MDA Space Ltd., where he applies his software development, robotics and control theory experience to mission analysis software for CanadArm 2 and R&D of future technologies for the new CanadArm 3.
  His primary role is as the technical lead for the path planning software component of CanadArm3's ground mission planning software.

      Underactuated control action &mdash; pitch and yaw &mdash; points the nose of the spacecraft body downward.
      The uncontrolled rotation about the body's forward axis (roll) is compensated for using the other two control inputs.

<h4>More About Rollen</h4>
Rollen graduated in 2017 with his Bachelors of Software Engineering (BSE), complemented with a joint honours in Applied Mathematics.
He completed a number of internships in the software engineering field with applications in game development, media programming and application programming.

During his PhD, Rollen investigated the application of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_ideal">exterior differential systems</a> to solving <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feedback_linearization">feedback equivalence problems</a>.
In particular, he developed a geometric algorithm for solving a class of feedback linearization problems which subsumes one of the most ubiquitious feedback equivalence problems: state-space, exact feedback linearization.
He was supervised by <a href="https://ece.uwaterloo.ca/~cnielsen/">Prof. Chris Nielsen</a>.
